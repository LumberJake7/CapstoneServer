My Menu:
This project showcases my proficiency in utilizing databases, integrating APIs, and employing both Flask/Python and JavaScript to create dynamic web applications. Designed for culinary enthusiasts and anyone looking to simplify their meal planning, this web application enables registered users to discover recipes based on ingredients they already have. By entering specific ingredients, users are presented with up to five recipes that utilize these components as key elements. This not only encourages creativity in the kitchen but also helps in minimizing food waste by making the most of available resources.

Further enhancing the user experience, the website provides detailed information on each recipe, including the necessary equipment and step-by-step cooking instructions, ensuring users have all they need to start cooking right away. For those who find recipes worth revisiting, there's the option to add them to "My Menu" â€“ a personalized collection of favored recipes. This feature allows users to easily access their curated selections at any time, streamlining the meal preparation process.
